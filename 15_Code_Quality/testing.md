1. Unit Testing

    Purpose: Test individual units or components of the code in isolation (e.g., functions, methods, or classes).
    Tools:

        unittest: Python's built-in testing framework.

        pytest: A popular third-party testing framework with simpler syntax and powerful features.


2. Integration Testing

    Purpose: Test how multiple units or components work together.

    Techniques:

        Fixtures: Reusable setup and teardown code for tests (e.g., database connections, test data).

        Mocking: Replace real dependencies with mock objects to isolate the system under test.


    Tools:

        unittest.mock: Built-in mocking library.
        pytest with fixtures: Simplifies integration testing.


3. Load Testing

    Purpose: Test how the system performs under heavy load or stress (e.g., high traffic, large datasets).

    Tools:

        locust: A Python-based tool for load testing.
        pytest-benchmark: For performance benchmarking.


4. Property-Based Testing

    Purpose: Test properties or invariants of the code by generating random inputs.

    Tools:
        
        hypothesis: A library for property-based testing.


5. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Behave

    Purpose: Write tests in a human-readable format to describe the behavior of the system.

    Tools:
        behave: A BDD framework for Python.


6. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

        Purpose: Test the entire application flow from start to finish.

        Tools:

            Selenium: For browser automation.
            Playwright: A modern alternative to Selenium.

7. Security Testing

    Purpose: Identify vulnerabilities in the code.
    Tools:

        bandit: A security linter for Python.


9. Mutation Testing

    Purpose: Evaluate the quality of your tests by introducing small changes (mutations) to the code and checking if the tests detect them.

    Tools:

        mutmut: A mutation testing tool for Python.
